Extra Credit

I have added a Click label to count how many clicks does the player use to win the game.

I have added a Level Label to count what level the player is on, each level you completed the next game will be harder.
The minimum steps to end the game should be more then the one before.

I have also added a clear button, it only works when you are in manual mode. When you clicked this button it clears the
board.
